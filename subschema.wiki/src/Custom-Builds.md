## Dependencies
Subschema compiles things into itself, if you want to use the source inside your project, and not the subschema dist files, you will need a few more deps.
* subschema-core
* subschema-dev-support

## Building
Subschema uses [mrbuilder](https://mr-builder.github.io) to build.  You can
find more information there how to modify the build system to suite your needs.
